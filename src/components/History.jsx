        The village has a long history, with archaeological evidence such as ancient cemeteries 
         indicating that the area has been inhabited for a significant period. The first Catholic church in
          Varnaviči was built in 1822. This wooden church was replaced in 1929 by a stone church, 
          constructed by Canon J. Borodzičs, which is located about 3 kilometers from the site of 
          the original church.
